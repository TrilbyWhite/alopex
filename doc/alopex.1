Alopex
\- A Tabbed, Tiling Window Manager with Fur 
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS

xinit alopex [\fItheme\fP]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
Alopex
is a dynamic tiling window manager with a container 
concept inspired by i3 but implemented quite differently. Client 
windows are not statically assigned to a given container, instead, 
containers each have a configurable maximum number of clients, and 
clients fill each container in sequence. Within containers, multiple 
clients are displayed as tabs. 
.PP
There are three container layouts: rstack, bstack, and 
monocle. Stack modes divide the screen into two sections, the master 
region and the stack. Monocle uses the full area for one container. 
All layouts stack clients within containers displaying a tab for each 
client in the container\&'s title bar. These layouts are supplimented by 
per\-client floating and full\-screen modes. 
.PP
Alopex
uses a tag concept rather than the more common 
workspace/desktop metaphor. The default configuration, however, is 
optimized for a workspace\-like work flow. This can be modified as 
desired. 
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION

.PP
Configuration is implemented via an X resources data base file which is 
read on startup. A well\-commented example configuration file is 
distributed with alopex
and can be found at 
/usr/share/alopex/config\&.
Further information on customizing and 
configuring alopex can be found on the github wiki. 
.PP
.SH STATUS INPUT

.PP
A child process specified in the configuration file can be launched to 
provide status input to be displayed along side the tabs in containers\&' 
bars. This child process should send text information to its standard 
output which will then be read in by alopex\&.
.PP
Each line must contain three ampersands which delineate four text 
segments. The first two segments are always displayed in the first 
container\&'s bar: the first before the tag indicators, the second 
immediately after the tag indicators. The third segment is displayed at 
the right side of the second container\&'s bar (or the right of the first 
container if there is only one visible). The fourth segment is 
displayed at the right side of the last visible container. 
.PP
Plain text is printed as is into the above\-specified status bar region. 
Text within curly\-braces is interpreted as a special indicator. These 
indicators can specify a foreground color, set a font, display an icon 
or paint the foreground color with an icon mask. Further documentation 
and examples can be found on the github wiki.
